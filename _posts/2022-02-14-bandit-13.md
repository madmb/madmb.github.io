## [](#header-1)Login

```bash
sshpass -p 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL \
ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220
```

## [](#header-1)Level Goal

```
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get
the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to
log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to
the machine you are working on

Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap
```

Utilizamos la clave privada desde bandit13@bandit  

```
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
```

Y accedemos al fichero donde está almacenada la pass

```
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
