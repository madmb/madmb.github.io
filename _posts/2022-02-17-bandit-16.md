## [](#header-1)Level Goal

```
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password
of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First
find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out 
which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give
the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap
```
